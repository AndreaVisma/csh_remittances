# Remittances work

Folder managed by Andrea Vismara of the Complexity Science Hub. 
The code collected here analyses the global flows in remittances.

**Remittances:** household income being generated by economic activity in 
another than the home economy, which subsequently is transferred to or 
earned on the account of the household in the home economy. 
As a consequence remittances can be either based upon long-term residence
in another country (usually combined with economic activity as migrant 
worker), or upon short-term work engagements as seasonal 
worker or upon permanent work as border worker without being 
resident of the host economy (European Commission).
